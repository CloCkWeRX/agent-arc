1) Copy app/config/example-default.ini to app/config/default.ini
2) Customise it as needed - you'll need at least two databases, one for the triplestore, one for the application
3) Make sure you have ARC2 in your include path. You can put lib/arc/ into it, or install a newer version elsewhere.
4) Set up a virtual host

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot g:/work/agent/app/html
    ServerName agent
</VirtualHost>

5) Make sure you allow .htaccess to work - AllowOverride All is kinda important (@todo fix the virtualhost example above)
